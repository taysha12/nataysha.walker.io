  <h1> Hello World! </h1>

<p id="poem">
Title: Being Alone
    I have found the anguish of the soul
      ,but it is very subtle
    to so many eyes

    I find it terrible
    for the obvious
    not to be seen

    Loneliness is our enemy
    but being alone isn't

    The effect of superficial attachment
    blinding us from seeing

    our own need for solitude

    the comfort of another soul
    the warmth of their embrace
    will subside our need
    for self dependence
    , but there is always a cry
    from our hearts

    urging us to look from within
    there should be space
    for your own

    A space for seclusion
    A space for privacy
    A space for self love
    A space for self motivation

    this too is what every soul are made of
    deal whatever it is
    that needs to be felt
    for you will only learn
    to know the rael you when you spend time
    alone with self.
